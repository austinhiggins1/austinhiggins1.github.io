<center><font color="white" size="7"><font size="8"> First and most importantly, the law states that it is very illegal to own a platypus for purposes of a "pet". Now, it is possibly to phyiscally go and take one of these things from the wild, but I don't really see how that is wise considdering the small number of them left. Most likely, you would end up getting tracked down by some sort of wildlife conservation group in an effort to return it to the wild. </font)>
